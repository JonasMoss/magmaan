# Speculative backlog

Items we may never need but want to keep findable. Each entry names the gap,
the cheaper alternative that already covers the practical case, and the
specific condition under which we'd actually build the item. Unlike
[`todo.md`](todo.md), nothing here is committed work — promote to `todo.md`
only when a concrete downstream consumer (paper row, user request, parity
failure) appears.

## Pairwise covariance / missing-data side

### Inference-side pairwise NT reducer

`robust::reduced_gamma_nt_pairwise(uf, raw, pw)` — same Γ_NT^pw machinery
as the GLS-side `data::gamma_nt_pairwise`, but projects through the
U-factor `B` to a df × df matrix instead of materializing the full
p* × p*. Slots into the existing `reduced_gamma_*` family and feeds the
model-implied-meat Satorra-Bentler / mean-variance-adjusted /
scaled-shifted chi-square corrections on pairwise-GLS fits.

**Alternative already available.** Pass the empirical influence matrix
`Ψ̂` from `robust::pairwise_casewise_contributions(raw, pw, include_means)`
into `reduced_gamma_sample(uf, Ψ̂, n)`. That gives the same SB / MV / SS
corrections with the *empirical* meat — the missing-data MLR / Huber-White
corner, which is what most incomplete-data robust SEM work reports
anyway.

**Build if.** A specific paper or comparator row needs model-implied-meat
SB chi-square on pairwise data (e.g. `pairwise-robust-sem` wants the
NT-meat row in addition to the empirical-meat row).

### Pairwise μ ACOV for `fit_gls_pairwise` mean-structure models

The μ-block of the GLS weight currently uses the Σ-only `Ŝ_pw⁻¹`
convention. The asymptotically efficient choice under MAR is
`(Γ_NT^μ-pw)⁻¹` with `Γ_NT^μ-pw_{j,k} = σ_{jk} · π_{jk}/(π_j π_k)` — the
same Hadamard structure as the σ-side, applied to the p × p mean ACOV.
Same pattern-grouped trick: enumerate distinct missingness patterns,
average masked-and-rescaled `Σ̂_pw` per pattern.

**Alternative already available.** The current Σ-only μ-block is
consistent under MAR; only asymptotic efficiency on the mean side is
sacrificed.

**Build if.** A pairwise-GLS fit with `meanstructure = TRUE` shows up as
a downstream consumer AND the means side carries non-trivial information
about θ AND the missingness is heavy enough that the μ-block weight
matters. Most CFA / SEM work fits `meanstructure = FALSE` so this is a
double-edge case.

### Pairwise Browne-unbiased

The paper (`papers/ugamma-fast/ugamma-fast.tex`, eq. 19) flags that the
literal finite-sample-unbiased pairwise Γ_u^pw has entrywise-dependent
overlap-set coefficients and does not collapse cleanly to the projected
form. Two paths exist, neither is core machinery:

- **Literal Γ_u^pw**: entrywise overlap-set bookkeeping, p*² entries
  each with its own (a_{ab}, b_{ab}) coefficients and overlap-restricted
  Γ_NT / rank-1 pieces. Worst-case O(p*² · n + p*² · df) per block.
  Expensive and intricate. This is the canonical estimator.

- **Pragmatic fallback**: global Browne coefficients with
  Hadamard-adjusted NT and rank-1 pieces. Cheap. Asymptotic behaviour
  of the substitution is not established literature.

**Alternative already available.** Complete-data Browne unbiased is in
`robust::reduced_gamma_unbiased`. Pairwise data with empirical meat
(Ψ̂'Ψ̂/n) is in `pairwise_casewise_contributions`. The model-implied NT
pairwise meat is the inference-side reducer above.

**Build if.** A downstream project needs a finite-sample-unbiased
pairwise meat AND the empirical alternative is demonstrably inadequate.
Path: literal first (so it's a credible reference); then pragmatic as
opt-in with a bias study comparing the two — see
[[feedback-shortcut-variants]] memo: pragmatic-only is research-tier
work, not a free addition.
