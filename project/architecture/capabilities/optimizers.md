### Optimizer backends

User-facing the optimizer is selected by a single kebab-case `optimizer = "..."`
string threaded through `fit_model()` and the underlying `fit_ml/fit_uls/fit_gls/
fit_wls/fit_*_snlls/fit_*_ordinal` entries; the table lives in
`cpp/include/magmaan/estimate/backend_strings.hpp` and parses into the C++
`Backend` enum. Accepted strings: `"ceres"`, `"ceres-bfgs"`,
`"nlopt-slsqp"`, `"nlopt-bobyqa"`, `"nlopt-tnewton"`, `"nlopt-var2"`,
`"nlopt-lbfgs"`, `"nlopt-lbfgs-slsqp-fallback"`, `"ipopt"`, `"port"`,
`"port-nls"`. The R side passes the same
string through to a single Rcpp shim per fit family — no per-Backend wrapper
explosion. Solver tuning rides on a generic `control = list(max_iter, ftol,
gtol, history)` argument.

The R complete-data ML and LS helpers also expose box constraints through
`bounds = list(lower, upper)` or the named bound builders
`bounds_variance()` / `bounds_pos_var()`, `bounds_standard()`,
`bounds_wide()`, and `bounds_loading()`. The high-level `fit_model()` ML, ULS,
GLS, WLS, and ordinal LS paths thread the same bounds object into the C++
fit layer; FIML remains unbounded at the R surface.

Optimizer outputs carry function/gradient evaluation counts plus a refined
success status and final stationarity diagnostic. The C++ `OptimResult` and
`estimate::Estimates` report `OptimStatus` (`Converged`,
`LineSearchSalvaged`, `SingularConvergence`, or `Unknown`) and a final
(projected, when bounded) gradient infinity norm when the backend can compute
one. R fit lists expose these as `optimizer_status` and `grad_norm`; the
`converged` field projects the common verdict (TRUE/FALSE/NA), independently
of the optimizer stop. A returned estimate need not pass that verdict.


- `Backend::NloptLbfgs` is the complete-data scalar default. FIML defaults to
  `Backend::NloptLbfgsSlsqpFallback`, which retries NLopt SLSQP from the same
  start if L-BFGS fails or returns a non-clean optimizer status. NLopt is a
  required dependency in the ordinary build, so both pieces of the fallback are
  always available.
  Known limitation: the NLopt Luksan L-BFGS line search allows ten step
  reductions, which can be insufficient to reach a finite objective from a
  valid start when parameter scales produce a large gradient. This can abort
  after 12 evaluations regardless of the overall evaluation budget. The
  standalone variance probe in `cpp/tests/checks/nlopt_lbfgs_domain.c` isolates the
  issue; the domain-recovery task is tracked in `project/backlog/todo.md`.
- `Backend::Port` is the trust-region cross-check: vendored PORT (Bell Labs)
  `drmngb_` (TOMS 611 Dennis-Gay-Welsch model-Hessian trust region; the
  algorithm behind R's `nlminb`), supports bounds natively. Vendored at
  `cpp/third_party/port/` from AMPL/ASL + Fermi-LAT (both BSD-3, manifest in
  `cpp/third_party/port/README.md`). Replaces the previous CppNumericalSolvers
  `Backend::TrustRegion`.
- `Backend::PortNls` is the least-squares-shape counterpart: PORT `drn2gb_`
  (TOMS 573 NL2SOL adaptive trust region — the algorithm behind R's `nls`).
  Drives the multi-residual `GmmProblem` directly through reverse
  communication (alternating R/J requests), so NL2SOL sees the true
  Gauss-Newton-plus-secant model Hessian instead of the scalarised
  ½‖r‖² collapse. On non-convex SNLLS problems with multiple local
  optima (e.g., Bollen's democracy SEM under GLS) it may converge to a
  different basin than the gradient backends; the cross-check tests
  document this rather than enforce agreement.
- `Backend::Ceres` / `Backend::CeresBfgs` cover Ceres Levenberg-Marquardt and
  dense line-search BFGS on the least-squares path (build with
  `MAGMAAN_WITH_CERES=ON`).
- `Backend::Ipopt` is the optional system-IPOPT interior-point backend (build
  with `MAGMAAN_WITH_IPOPT=ON`). It is available as a general scalar optimizer
  and accepts nonlinear equality constraints. v1 uses IPOPT's limited-memory
  Hessian approximation, so magmaan supplies objective gradients and
  constraint Jacobians but not exact Lagrangian Hessians.
- `Backend::NloptSlsqp` exposes NLopt's SLSQP for ML, FIML, and LS scalar
  paths (gradient SQP, Kraft 1988). It accepts simple bounds and nonlinear
  equality constraints via analytic constraint Jacobians.
- `Backend::NloptBobyqa`, `Backend::NloptTnewton`, `Backend::NloptVar2`,
  `Backend::NloptLbfgs` round out the NLopt roster with distinct algorithm
  ideas: Powell 2009 derivative-free quadratic-model trust region (BOBYQA,
  finite bounds required); Nash 1985 preconditioned truncated Newton with
  CG inner solve (TNEWTON); Shanno-Phua 1980 full (dense) variable-metric
  BFGS (VAR2); and NLopt's own L-BFGS. All five share the one
  `NloptOptimizer` adapter parameterised over an opaque
  `NloptAlgorithm` enum.
- The local `ceres` and `ipopt` presets are optional optimizer comparison
  builds. Ceres is FetchContent-managed; IPOPT is deliberately a system
  dependency because its BLAS/LAPACK and sparse-linear-solver stack is a
  toolchain choice. `just r-install-ceres` and `just r-install-ipopt` mirror
  the relevant compile definition into the R shared object so the accepted
  optimizer strings are executable from the R dev surface in one install.
