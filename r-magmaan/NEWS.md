# magmaan 0.1.0

First simulation prerelease, paired with magmaanlab 0.1.0. The ordinary API
accepts lavaan syntax and lavaan-backed model specifications. EQS is lab-only.

- Saved specifications supply ordered variables, parameterization and grouping;
  conflicting call options error before fitting. Row accounting uses the
  resolved grouping.
- Defined parameter estimates are retained independently of inference.
- Confidence levels and parameter selections are validated. Unchecked
  convergence is distinguished from a failed fit.
- Help pages and the README document extraction for simulation consumers.

Automatic policy inference covers single-level complete-data ML. Other
estimators retain their estimates and report unsupported inference components.
This prerelease does not expand inference coverage or change its defaults.
